#
# This is a thin delegating hook: all rewrite logic lives in `rtk rewrite`,
# which is the single source of truth (src/discover/registry.rs).
# To add or change rewrite rules, edit the Rust registry — not this file.

# NEVER rewrite a command into `rtk read` (downbeat#254).
#
# `rtk read` STRIPS COMMENT LINES and renumbers what remains from 1. Measured
# 2026-08-17 on rtk 0.31.0: a 51 line Swift file came back as 28 lines. So every
# line number taken from it is wrong AND plausible, which is worse than mangled
# output, because a wrong line number looks exactly like a line number. Three
# consecutive planning passes cited wrong file:line pairs for this reason and
# each one corrected the previous pass's numbers rather than suspecting the
# instrument.
#
# This refuses by the DESTINATION rather than by the source command. rtk's own
# `[hooks] exclude_commands` setting honours `cat` but is ignored for `head` and
# `tail` (measured on 0.31.0 with all three listed), so a source based list both
# misses those two and would miss the next command that starts mapping here.
# Whatever produced it, `rtk read` is the thing that corrupts the output.
#
# Everything else still goes through rtk, which is the point: git, gh and the
# rest keep saving tokens. Only file reads pass through untouched.
